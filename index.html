        <h1>Hi, I'm Aditi! </h1>

        <p>I'm a student at Cornell University studying Computer Science and English. My professional interests lie
          within the
          intersection of technology and the humanities. I'm a strong believer in volunteer work, and in
          ethically-oriented product
          design and development. </p>
        <p>This summer, I've had the privilege of being accepted into Develop for Good's program, and have been working
          with
          organization USAHello to fine-tune their web and mobile application. I've also been developing for
          DevLaunchers, a company
          that aims to bridge the education gap. If I'm not working on these projects, you'll probably find me
          rehearsing with my a cappella
          group, the
          Chordials, instead! </p>
        <p>Please don't hesitate to reach out, whether it's to get to know more about my work, or just a casual chat!
          <br> You can contact me at ak749[at]cornell[dot]edu!!
        </p>
