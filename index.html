                    <h3> Academics </h3>
                    <p>I am a senior majoring in Computer Science at Cornell University, and am graduating in August 2023. Growing up, I never thought I would pursue computer science. I had always been someone oriented to the arts, so what was staring at an IDE for hours straight going to do for me? Luckily, I eventually came to realize the immense creative effort that came with this discipline. Studying at Cornell has introduced me to some immensely cool people - I am reminded of the human power to change the world every day.</p>

                    <h3> Technological Interests </h3>
                    <p>I find software engineering very fascinating, and have accepted a position as a full-time development engineer. I will be working in full stack development. I am also very interested in natural language processing and data science. Above all, I want to learn how to achieve technological excellence while always keeping ethics in mind. </p>

                    <h3>Artistic Interests</h3>
                    <p>For as long as I can remember, I have loved to read, sing and draw. I think that these passions have really improved the way I approach technical problems. They have taught me communication and empathy, and have created an eye for elegant design. Whatever work I do, I strive to incorporate these principles, so I can deliver the best possible product.

              <p>I believe that the best technologies are made when ethics are the central consideration. It can be really easy to lose track of the bigger picture, but innovation should always be made with the intention of improving peopleâ€™s lives. </p>
              <p> I love looking for ways to help with sites like <a href="https://www.volunteermatch.org/"> VolunteerMatch</a>, that help me find non-profits that need help, technical or otherwise.
